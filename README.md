# Foodbook Front-end

[Foodbook](https://github.com/ethan-berman/Foodbook) was my final project for CS-301 at Whitman College.
This is a React app that consumes the Foodbook API. This project is to learn how to use redux and redux-sagas, using an existing server that I am familiar with. 
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
